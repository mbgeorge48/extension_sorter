# Extension Sorter

Super simple script for sorting all the files in a given directory by their extension 

i.e. All txt files will be put in a txt folder etc.

The script only uses the OS and Sys modules so you won't need anything fancy setup for this

## Running the script

You pass in the directory you want to sort as a parameter when calling the script

`python ext_sorter.py <path to folder>`
